              At Modafinil Sydney, we genuinely care about our customers and want every order to arrive safely, on time, and exactly as expected. Because we supply pharmaceutical products that require careful handling, our returns and refund process is slightly different from what you might experience with regular retail items. The following information explains how we handle all matters related to refunds, replacements, and delivery issues so you can shop with complete confidence.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">Our Promise to You</h2>
              <p>
                We stand behind the quality of every item we sell. All Modafinil products are sourced from trusted, licensed suppliers and shipped directly from our international dispatch partners in India. We guarantee that your order will reach you in good condition and within the timeframe stated on our website. If your package is delayed, lost, or damaged in transit, we&apos;ll make things right — either through a free reshipment or a full refund, depending on the circumstances. We value fairness and transparency. Our goal is to ensure every customer has a safe, smooth and positive experience with us, from checkout to delivery.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">Due to Safety Regulations – No Returns on Medications</h2>
              <p>
                Because we deal with pharmaceutical products, we cannot accept physical returns once an order has been shipped. This is not just our policy — it&apos;s a strict requirement under health and safety laws in Australia and internationally. See what the ACC has to say here. Once medications leave the warehouse, they can&apos;t be restocked, resold, or reused for safety reasons. This helps protect all customers by ensuring every product remains tamper-free and stored under controlled conditions. Even unopened packs cannot be returned due to chain-of-custody and contamination risks. We therefore recommend carefully reviewing your order details before checkout.

              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Non-Delivery or Lost Shipment</strong> – If your parcel does not arrive within our advertised timeframe (plus a reasonable allowance for postal delays), we will investigate with our logistics provider. If the parcel cannot be located, we will either reship your order at no extra cost or issue a full refund.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Damaged Goods on Arrival</strong> – If your order arrives damaged, please take clear photos of the packaging and contents immediately and contact our support team. Once verified, we&apos;ll promptly organise a replacement or a full refund.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Incorrect or Incomplete Order</strong> – In rare cases where the incorrect product or quantity is sent, we will send the missing or correct items without additional shipping charges. Our customer service team is available 24/7 to handle these requests and ensure a fair resolution every time.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">How to Request a Refund or Reshipment</h2>
              <p>
                If something isn&apos;t right with your order, please contact us within 7 days of receiving your parcel (or after the expected delivery window if it never arrived). You can reach our customer service team anytime via the contact form or email listed on our Modafinil Sydney contact us page. When getting in touch, please include your full name and order number, the date of purchase, a brief description of the issue, and supporting evidence (such as photos, if applicable). We&apos;ll assess your case within a few business days and get back to you with a clear resolution. If your claim is approved, you&apos;ll receive either a reshipment tracking number or confirmation of your refund.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">Refund Processing Time</h2>
              <p>
                Refunds are processed back to your original payment method unless otherwise requested. Processing times depend on your bank or card provider and may take 3–10 business days. We do not charge any additional fees for refunds or replacements, although minor exchange-rate or transaction fees may apply depending on your payment provider — these are outside our control.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">Cancellations Before Dispatch</h2>
              <p>
                If you change your mind and wish to cancel your order, you must do so before it has been shipped. Once a parcel is dispatched, cancellation is not possible due to the automated nature of our logistics network. To avoid delays or unwanted shipments, please contact customer support immediately after placing your order if you wish to cancel. Best way to do this is send us an email to: <a href="mailto:orders@modafinilaustraliadirect.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">orders@modafinilaustraliadirect.com</a>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">When Refunds Are Not Possible</h2>
              <p>
                To ensure safety and fairness, refunds cannot be issued in the following cases: the order has already been delivered and signed for, and no issue was reported within 7 days; the product has been used, opened, or tampered with; a change of mind occurred after dispatch; or the customer provided an incorrect shipping address. We always encourage customers to double-check their delivery details before checkout.

              <p>
                We understand that sometimes things go wrong, but please contact us before initiating any chargeback with your bank or card provider. We pride ourselves on fast, fair resolutions and always act in good faith. Unwarranted chargebacks create unnecessary delays and may result in permanent account suspension.
